# Eth-Avax Intermediate Course Project - Module 2

Welcome to the Eth-Avax Intermediate Course Project - Module 2! This project showcases a Solidity smart contract and a corresponding frontend application.

## Overview

The project revolves around a smart contract implemented in `Bank.sol`. This contract is a part of the hands-on exercises provided in the Eth-Avax Intermediate Course's second module.

## How to Explore

- **Smart Contract:** The main logic can be found in `Bank.sol`. Dive into this file to understand the core functionality and features implemented in the contract.

- **Frontend Interface:** The frontend of the application is designed for user interaction. Explore the interactive components by checking out `App.js` and the styling in `App.css`.

- **Deployment Code:** The deployment code, essential for deploying the smart contract, is encapsulated in `Deploy.js`. This file provides the necessary setup for deploying your contract on the Ethereum and Avalanche networks.

## Usage

- **Deploying the Contract:** Use the provided deployment code (`Deploy.js`) to deploy the smart contract on your preferred blockchain network, be it Ethereum or Avalanche.

- **Interacting with the Frontend:** Once deployed, explore the frontend interface (`App.js` and `App.css`) to interact with the functionalities provided by the smart contract.
